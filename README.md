QSL Creator is under development and is not complete

Goals:

	1 - browse a ADIF file 
	2 - Supply QRZ info for lookups 
	3 - Select an image 
	4 - Click process to create a QSL card for each record
	5 - Email each card that has an email address from QRZ 
	6 - make folder for cards to be manually sent..  (no email address) 

Future:

	Automatic post to FTP site for delivery 
	Automatic upload to dropbox

	Optional ability to send cards to a printer to have a "photo" of card printed and mailed. 

An alternative version could be web based and allow users to pickup a card if they need one.
